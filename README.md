# dotfiles
Well, as the name says, dotfiles! I'm using stow for managing them.
And yes, I know, my neovim config is in Vimscript. I haven't had the time
to migrate it to Lua. Deal with it! :D

## Usage
To install or update the configuration run:
```bash
make
```

To remove it again use:
```bash
make clean
```
